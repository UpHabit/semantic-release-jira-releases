## Install

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev semantic-release-jira-releases
$ yarn add --dev semantic-release-jira-releases
```

### Configuration
The plugin should be added to your config
```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    "@semantic-release/git",
    ["semantic-release-jira-releases", {
      "projectId": "1",
      "releaseNameTemplate": "Test v${version}",
      "jiraHost": "uphabit.atlassian.net",
      "ticketPrefixes": [ "TEST", "UH"],
      "ticketRegex": "[a-zA-Z]{3,5}-\\d{3,5}"
    }]
  ]
}

Please note that `ticketRegex` cannot be used together with `ticketPrefixes`.
```
```typescript
interface Config {
  
  /// A domain of a jira instance ie: `uphabit.atlasian.net`
  jiraHost: string;

  // A list of prefixes to match when looking for tickets in commits. Cannot be used together with ticketRegex.
  // ie. ['TEST'] would match `TEST-123` and `TEST-456`
  ticketPrefixes?: string[];

  // A unescaped regex to match tickets in commits (without slashes). Cannot be used together with ticketPrefixes.
  // ie. [a-zA-Z]{4}-\d{3,5} would match any ticket with 3 letters a dash and 3 to 5 numbers, such as `TEST-456`, `TEST-5643` and `TEST-56432`
  ticketRegex?: string;
  
  // The id for the project releases will be created in
  projectId: number;
  
  // A lodash template with a single `version` variable
  // defaults to `v${version}` which results in a version that is named like `v1.0.0`
  // ex: `Semantic Release v${version}` results in `Semantic Release v1.0.0`
  releaseNameTemplate?: string;

  // The number of maximum parallel network calls, default 10
  networkConcurrency?: number;

  // indicates if a new release created in jira should be set as released
  released?: boolean;

  // include the release date when creating a release in jira
  releaseDate?: boolean;
}
```
